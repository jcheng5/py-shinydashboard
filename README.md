Note: It's quite possible that the approach taken by this repo ends up not being "the" long-term approach to creating dashboards in Shiny for Python; on the Shiny for R side, the [shinydashboard R package](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) competes with [flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) and the up-and-coming [gridlayout](https://rstudio.github.io/gridlayout/), and those are just the "official" packages from Posit.
